# Smart Event Planner - Simple UI

## How to Use

1. Start the FastAPI server (as before).
2. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser.
3. Fill out the event form and submit to get weather and recommendations for your event.

This UI is for demo purposes and interacts with the backend API endpoints.
